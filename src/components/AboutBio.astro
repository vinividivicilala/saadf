    description={`Hello! 👋 I am a passionate full-stack developer based in Santiago, Chile. Currently, I am a part of the team at Opis, an innovative startup with a focus on environmental issues, where I continuously expand my skills and knowledge in the technological field.

      Before joining Opis, I had the privilege of working with prominent companies like Dreambox and Approvecha, contributing to the development of innovative projects. 👨‍💻
      
      Besides my love for programming, I am fascinated by learning new things and always on the lookout for opportunities to broaden my horizons. 📚 I also enjoy music and love playing the guitar 🎸, exploring a wide variety of styles, with metal being my favorite. 🤘
      
      I can't deny that I'm an animal lover 🐾. I take care of some furry friends 😄 with much affection and patience at home, and they make my life more special.
      
      I'm always open to connecting with like-minded people and sharing experiences, so feel free to get in touch with me. You can reach me at <a class="text-sky-300" href="mailto:migueltroncoso.ga@gmail.com"><b>Send Email📧</b></a> or follow me on my social media. Looking forward to connecting with you soon! 🤝`}
