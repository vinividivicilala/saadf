This project is a platform that allows users to write and publish articles on topics related to technology, business, and creativity. Each user can have their own profile and blog, using a powerful text editor with **Markdown** support, which facilitates a rich writing **experience**.
<br/>
On the frontend , modern technologies like <span style="color:cyan">**React**</span> are used, along with customizable libraries for the user interface, animations, and transitions to enhance the visual experience. Tools are also used for smooth navigation between pages and syntax highlighting in code blocks.
<br/>
As for the backend, it follows an MVC pattern and uses **JSON Web Token**s for authentication, guaranteeing secure access. The data is stored in an <span style="color:#003a96">**AWS DynamoDB**</span>, which allows great scalability. The backend part is based on <span style="color:green"> **Node.js**</span> and uses various libraries, such as **Express.js**, aws-sdk, and jsonwebtoken.
